"""
This file contains the API which will allow our local backend to interface with Kamiak.
It will contain the protocols for sending jobs to Kamiak and receiving the results of those jobs.
It will have three classes:
    API_to_Kamiak, which will include methods for copying algorithm code to Kamiak and sending batch files to Kamiak that will run that code and return the result.
    API_to_Frontend, which will include methods for interfacing with the frontend of the program.
    API_to_Preprocessing, which will include methods for using the preprocessing module to access and process data files.
