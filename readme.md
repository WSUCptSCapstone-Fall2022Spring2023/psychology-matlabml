# **Psychology MatLab-ML**

## The Henricks lab at WSU is studying the neurobiology of substance use by using rodent experiment subjects. They intend on identifying which parts of the brain play a part in substance use, as well as the sex differences present in substance use between males and females. Their long-term goal is to use this research to develop therapies for people who suffer from substance abuse.

- Our team is helping the Henricks lab by building machine learning models that make predictions on whether subjects are experiment or control and how much alcohol subjects have drank during an experiment session.

- End Goal: Present machine learning models that make predictions on whether subjects are experiment or control and how much alcohol subjects have drank during an experiment session. We should have multiple models representing groups of only males and females.

- A previous team of WSU students worked with the Henricks lab for their capstone project. We will build on their sucesses to further aid the Henricks lab. Dr. Henricks has a codebase in Matlab. We have been requested to refactor that code into Python so that future teams can more easily maintain it.

## Prerequisites

- Python v3.9.5
- Python dependencies installed by running `pip install -r requirements-3.9.5.txt`
