# **Psychology MatLab-ML**

## The Henricks lab at WSU is studying the neurobiology of substance use by using rodent experiment subjects. They intend on identifying which parts of the brain play a part in substance use, as well as the sex differences present in substance use between males and females. Their long-term goal is to use this research to develop therapies for people who suffer from substance abuse.

### Our team is helping the Henricks lab by improving their capacity to process data, performing machine learning to predict imminent alcohol drinking in rodents, and creating a protocol, preferrably a GUI, to make our code accessbile to gradute students who might not have coding experience.

### End Goal: Present a desktop application that can input a machine learning model and the LFP data from one experiment session and output the timestamps for when the model predicts the rodent specimen begins considering drinking alcohol.


### A previous team of WSU students worked with the Henricks lab for their capstone project. We will build on their sucesses to further aid the Henricks lab. Dr. Henricks has a codebase in Matlab. We have been requested to refactor that code into Python so that future teams can more easily maintain it.
