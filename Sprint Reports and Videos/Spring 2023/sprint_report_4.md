# Sprint x Report (1/6/23 - 2/2/23)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Data Cleaning for the 60hz Filter
 * Downsampling Data to Improve Preprocessing Speed

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint, our team reconnected with our client and discussed our plans for the upcoming semester.
We reoriented in ourselves with our project after a long break.
We learned that the data for our primary goal has not been prepared yet, so we were assigned two new tasks, which are a binary predictor for if a rodent is dependent or non-dependent and a continuous predictor for how much alcohol the rodent drank during an experiment session.
We implemented the remaining two functions necessary to clean data during preprocessing.
We worked on the first draft of our MVP Project Report.

## Unfinished Work
We have not been able to finish the continuous predictor.
We have not finished the preprocessing code for the new data we have been given.

## Completed Issues/User Stories
Here are links to the issues that we completed in this sprint:

## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
Here are links to issues we worked on but did not complete in this sprint:
 
 * https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2022Spring2023/psychology-matlabml/issues/53 "The data given to us by our client wasn't formatted properly, so our client offered to reformat the data and give it to us in a form that can be processed by a program"

## Code Files for Review
Please review the following code files, which were actively developed during this sprint, for quality:

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * We were able to open communications again with our client quickly.
  * We finished the data cleaning tasks that were left over from last sprint quickly.
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Write more code!
   * Add to our MVP report iteratively over the sprint instead of days before it is due.
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Continuous predictor preprocessing module will be finished.
   * Work on the logic module for continuous predictions.
   * Set up the API which connects our modules and frontend components.
