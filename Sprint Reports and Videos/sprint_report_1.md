# Sprint x Report (8/26/2022 - 10/09/2022)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Added mockup of GUI with buttons.

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
	In this sprint we began looking at the previous team's code and gained an understanding of Dr. Henricks' lab's work and how their data is collected.
	We also learned from Dr. Henricks what features this software should have. 
	She didn't expect software, while the deliverables for the class were all software oriented, so we also figured out how to include software development expectations into a machine learning project by encasing the machine learning process in a desktop application.
	We also planned the software architecture.
	Our biggest hurdle was learning how to interact with clients instead of performing tasks from a school assignment.

## Unfinished Work
	- We didn't have a goal since this was our first sprint and we didn't know what to expect
	- Converting old MatLab files to Python
	- Getting to see what the data looks like
	- Setting up software architecture in code

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * Communication between team members. No team member was in the dark
  * Documents were up to standard
  * Got a good idea of our project goal and what the client wants
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Communication with our client. We were intending using the lab's weekly meetings to keep in contact, but two meetings in a row were cancelled this sprint, so we need to find another way to keep in contact
   * Using separate branches for each team members' work. Since we were mainly working documents this wasn't an issue, but it is something we should do once we get into coding.
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Use GitHub issues to keep track of deliverables.
   * Now that we have a grasp on the task at hand, we will plan out the next sprint better.
   * We will also use a Kanban board to assign tasks to team members.
